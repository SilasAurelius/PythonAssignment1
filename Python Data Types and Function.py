3. Python Data Types and type() Function
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

Task 1: Code Correction
Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable and then use the type() function to print it out:

variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True
"""

variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True

print(variable_a, type(variable_a))
print(variable_b, type(variable_b))
print(variable_c, type(variable_c))
print(variable_d, type(variable_d))

# Using the print function, I can print the value of my variables as well as nest another function within the same line to print the type of the variable.
